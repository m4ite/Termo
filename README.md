## ðŸ”Ž How it works?
> Based on the <a href="https://term.ooo">termo website</a>, this project recreates the idea of â€‹â€‹the game that consists of guessing a 5-letter word in 10 attempts.
> The code reads the text file that has words, randomly chooses a word and the user through the console must hit the random word.
> The game ends when the player guess the random work.
